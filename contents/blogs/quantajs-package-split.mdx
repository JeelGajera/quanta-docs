# QuantaJS Package Split: A New Era of Modularity

We're excited to announce a major milestone in QuantaJS development! After months of planning and development, we've successfully split QuantaJS into two distinct packages: **@quantajs/core** and **@quantajs/react**. This refactoring brings significant improvements in modularity, performance, and developer experience.

## Why We Split the Package

The original QuantaJS package served us well, but as the library grew in popularity and complexity, we identified several areas for improvement:

### 1. **Framework Agnostic Core**
The core state management logic is now completely framework-agnostic. This means you can use QuantaJS with any JavaScript framework or even vanilla JavaScript applications.

### 2. **Reduced Bundle Size**
By separating React-specific code from the core, applications that don't use React can now import only the essential state management features, resulting in smaller bundle sizes.

### 3. **Better Tree Shaking**
The modular structure allows bundlers to better eliminate unused code, further reducing the final bundle size.

### 4. **Clearer API Boundaries**
The separation makes it easier to understand which features are core functionality versus framework-specific integrations.

## What's in Each Package

### @quantajs/core
The framework-agnostic core package contains all the essential state management features:

- **`createStore`** - Create reactive stores with state, getters, and actions
- **`reactive`** - Make objects, arrays, Maps, and Sets reactive
- **`computed`** - Create derived, cached reactive values
- **`watch`** - Observe reactive state changes and run side effects

```typescript:store.ts
import { createStore, reactive, computed, watch } from '@quantajs/core';

// Create a store
const counterStore = createStore('counter', {
  state: () => ({ count: 0 }),
  getters: {
    doubleCount: (state) => state.count * 2
  },
  actions: {
    increment() { this.count++; }
  }
});

// Use reactive objects
const user = reactive({ name: 'John', age: 30 });

// Create computed values
const userInfo = computed(() => `${user.name} is ${user.age} years old`);

// Watch for changes
watch(() => user.age, (newAge) => {
  console.log(`User age changed to ${newAge}`);
});
```

### @quantajs/react
The React-specific package provides seamless integration with React applications:

- **`useStore`** - Hook to access store from React context
- **`useQuantaStore`** - Hook to subscribe to a specific store
- **`useCreateStore`** - Hook to create component-scoped stores
- **`QuantaProvider`** - React context provider for stores

```typescript:app.tsx
import { QuantaProvider, useStore, useQuantaStore } from '@quantajs/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <QuantaProvider store={counterStore}>
      <Counter />
    </QuantaProvider>
  );
}

function Counter() {
  const store = useStore();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {store.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => store.increment()}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Migration Guide

If you're using the original QuantaJS package, here's how to migrate:

### For React Applications
```bash
# Remove the old package
npm uninstall quantajs

# Install the new packages
npm install @quantajs/core @quantajs/react
```

Update your imports:
```typescript
// Old
import { createStore, useStore } from 'quantajs';

// New
import { createStore } from '@quantajs/core';
import { useStore } from '@quantajs/react';
```

### For Non-React Applications
```bash
# Install only the core package
npm install @quantajs/core
```

```typescript
// Import from core package
import { createStore, reactive, computed, watch } from '@quantajs/core';
```

## Performance Improvements

The package split brings several performance benefits:

1. **Smaller Initial Bundle**: React applications can now tree-shake unused core features
2. **Faster Startup**: Reduced parsing time for non-React applications
3. **Better Caching**: Separate packages can be cached independently
4. **Optimized Imports**: Direct imports from specific packages

## What's Next

This package split is just the beginning. We have exciting plans for the future:

- **DevTools**: Dedicated debugging tools for QuantaJS
- **Persistence**: Automatic state persistence with multiple backends
- **Distributed State**: Multi-window and worker state synchronization

## Community Feedback

We'd love to hear your thoughts on this refactoring! Join our discussions on GitHub and let us know:

- How the migration process went for you
- Any performance improvements you've noticed
- Ideas for future framework integrations
- Suggestions for the upcoming DevTools

## Conclusion

The QuantaJS package split represents our commitment to building a robust, flexible, and performant state management solution. By separating concerns and providing clear API boundaries, we're making QuantaJS more accessible to developers across different ecosystems.

Whether you're building a React application, a vanilla JavaScript project, or exploring other frameworks, QuantaJS now provides the right tools for your specific needs.

Happy coding with QuantaJS! ðŸš€
